# ðŸŽŸ SKY Token

## Main information

While RAY token is the "fiat" currency of the blockchain, SKY tokens' main function is preservation and enhancement of investments. It will have a high deflation rate.

Its supply is limited. There will be only 100 000 000 SKY tokens totally. SKY token distribution will be balanced. Only approximately 15% of it will be mined during first 365 days. That also means that no one can hold a significant share of its total supply.

With the Grinder, it is possible to reward validators according to more flexible rules (for example, depending on the percentage of time online), as fees are not received directly by the network nodes but are burned.

## SKY to RAY

SKY token will be used to print RAY tokens. But the amount of printing RAYs will be determined by the Grinder. That means that no one could print more RAYs than the Grinder allows. This will not only protect RAY from hyper-inflation, but also will prevent hyper-deflation of SKY token.

But it will be impossible to buy SKY with RAY. The only way to earn SKY is to become a validator.

> In a simple words, SKY token is a RAY printing certificate that can be used anytime.

## SKY token DAO

RAY token will have its inflation. But in order to remain able to meet the needs of society, a DAO will be created.

This DAO will determine the target inflation and a value of RAY relative to the outer world. To add more value to SKY, the number of votes will be proportional to the amount of SKY in the wallet.

> This is one of the possible ways to add more value to SKY token. It is not a necessary plan.
