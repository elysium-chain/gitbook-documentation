# üéÅ Initial Validators

There will be a barrier for new validators in the Elysium network. For initial validators, the Pioneers Program plays the role of such a barrier. So, at least the first year after the Elysium launch, the initial validators will be the only validators in the network. During this period approximately 15 000 000 SKY tokens will be mined by them.&#x20;

The network layer will be operated by the Elysium Team until this part of the network is heavily tested. So many of the SKY tokens will go to the Team as Routers' rewards. The Team will need them for further development of Elysium such as making bridges, providing liquidity for CEXs, offering grants for developers, etc.

In the first year after the launch of Elysium, there will be a lot of infrastructure development. Before the first bridge to Ethereum goes live the network will be closed for everyone except initial validators and developers with grants from the Team.

Those participants of the Pioneers Program who have achieved the 50th level will join the network one by one depending on their place on the leaderboard of the Pioneers Program. So the better the results - the sooner you will be able to start mining SKY tokens.

## FAQ

### What type of computer do I need to be a validator?

We will find it during the testnet phase. But our PoV consensus is light and does need heavy calculations. Also, it will use only a CPU, so at rough estimation, an ordinary workstation will do.

### Do I need to run my computer 24 hours a day?

It's on you. But while your node is offline it won't be mining SKY.&#x20;

### Can I run the node program on the server?

Yes. We will make a special server edition of the validator node that could be installed on a common Linux VPS.

### Do I need to invest something as an initial validator?

No. The only cost for you to be a validator could be renting a Linux VPS (\~$10 per month) if you don't want to use your home desktop computer. When you become a validator it's time to make money, not spend it. :smile:
