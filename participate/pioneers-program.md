# ðŸŽ® Pioneers Program

The Pioneer Program will be a game on the Ethereum network. The participant's goal will be to improve a virtual computer representing the future Elysium node. The higher the level of this virtual computer at the time of the Elysium launch, the more bonuses the participant will receive in the Elysium network. Anyone who makes it to the 50th level will become one of the [initial validators](early-validators.md).

## The rules

The virtual node consists of three component types: USB ports, CPUs, and HDDs. Also, there will be Flash Drives containing some quantity of Bytes. The main goal is to process Bytes from the Flash Drives into the Upgrade Points (UPs for short). These UPs then can be used to upgrade the virtual node in two dimensions: either the level of existing USB ports, CPUs, or HDDs could be raised or the new USB ports, CPUs, and HDDs could be added.&#x20;

The maximum count of similar components is 10. So there could not be more than 10 USB ports, CPUs, or HDDs. Each of the components can be upgraded to the 100th level.

Flash Drives connect to USB ports. The level of the port influences the speed at which the Bytes from Flash Drives proceed. The more ports are added the more Flash Drives could be connected simoultenionsly.

CPUs convert Bytes received from the Flash Drives via USB ports to UPs at a certain ratio. The higher the level of the CPU the greater its ratio. Different CPUs result in multiplying their ratios.

Obtained via CPUs UPs are stored on HDDs. The higher the level of the HDD the larger the space for storing UPs. The spaces from different HDDs are summarised. If there is no space left the process stops before the HDDs are emptied.

To get Flash Drives players will need to take part in daily tournaments at which a certain amount of Flash Drives will be raffled among all participants.&#x20;

## FAQ

### Why is the Pioneers Program a game?

We decided to implement the Program playfully for two reasons. First, it will promote the constant involvement of the pioneers, and second, it will make it impossible for one person to own several high-level game nodes. In other words, this approach is much better at preventing Sybil attacks than KYC.

### What mechanics exactly will interfere with multi-accountants?

The main part of the Pioneers Program will be mini-games, which pioneers will need to play simultaneously. In other words, there will be daily tournaments through which some resources needed to progress a virtual node will be rewarded to players. There will be 1-4 (depending on the number of mini-games) tournaments a day - each will take approximately 5 minutes. To keep everyone equal, the tournaments' start times will be shifted by one hour each day.
