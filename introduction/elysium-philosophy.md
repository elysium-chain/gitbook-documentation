# ðŸ“— Elysium philosophy

In today's world, quite a few new blockchains are emerging. The community perceives them as an easy way to make money on investments. And the significant factors for investment decisions are: what funds take part in the project, what services will switch to this blockchain, how much marketing money is in the budget, and so on.&#x20;

It's almost indistinguishable from investing in a shopping mall. And with this stream-like business approach, almost nothing new can emerge because any real innovation is a risk that big investors usually refuse to take. But it wasn't like that until very recently.

Bitcoin originated as a decentralized system with incentives for participants. Before it appeared, the advantages of distributed systems were evident. But people were not eager to run node programs to support them because it required keeping the home computer always turned on.

That is why Bitcoin became, first of all, an experiment to create a decentralized system in which working nodes get rewards. By the way, this is why Bitcoin's consensus is called Proof of Work (PoW). Accordingly, there were no monetary barriers to entry for new participants - on the contrary, anyone with a computer was welcomed and could become a miner without any costs.

In turn, the slogan of the increasingly popular Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus states: "we do a cool business using blockchain technology, and you can invest too." The meaning rolled over! If it used to be "participate and get paid," it's now "pay to participate."

The [Elysium Team](elysium-team.md) wants to bring back the bright days of cryptocurrencies' dawn and has adopted Bitcoin's approach as its basic creed. Elysium is a unique decentralized system that focuses on the interests of ordinary people, who in turn support it.

That's why any person with a computer can become a validator in the Elysium network, and no financial investments are required. But this will be possible only sometime after the launch of Elysium. The first time after the start, the network will be secured by a pool of [initial validators](../participate/early-validators.md) - an analog of the first miners in the Bitcoin network.

The conception of initial validators helps to avoid centralized funding from venture capital funds. This way, the team will be fully able to turn their ideas into reality, the initial validators will be decently rewarded, and the blockchain will be as decentralized as possible immediately after launch.

Therefore, we are building a strong community of enthusiasts simultaneously with blockchain development. And if you want to be one of the initial validators, check out the "[participate](broken-reference)" section.
