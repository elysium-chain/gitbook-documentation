# ‚ùì FAQ

### Do you have two tokens? But LUNA also did, and it collapsed!

If some single-token system goes bankrupt, it doesn't mean all single-token mechanics are doomed. We have fundamentally different mechanics from LUNA, self-sufficient and not directly tied to the real world. Thus, it cannot be broken by external manipulation, as it happened with LUNA.

### How will I be able to deposit or withdraw money from Elysium?

In the beginning, a bridge with Ethereum will be set up to interact with the outside world, allowing users to use wrapped Eth in Elysium. It will also be possible to withdraw capital from the Elysium network using this bridge.&#x20;

Bridges to other popular blockchains will be created in the future. If necessary, it will be possible to make a bridge with reverse logic, where RAY or SKY is withdrawn from Elysium, and in another blockchain, the user receives wrapped RAY or SKY tokens.

### What happens if no one puts SKY in the Grinder?

That won't happen. At least, the Elysium Team will put a single SKY in the Grinder queue at a price sufficient to issue a billion RAYs. And we have no doubt that there will be many such overpriced orders.

### SKY will not be burned when trading on the exchanges. Will it break the system?

There will be DEX in Elysium, so it will be possible to trade SKY for RAY outside the Grinder.&#x20;

If the price of SKY on DEX drops much relative to prices in the Grinder queue, it will open up the possibility for arbitrage. Anyone can buy a cheap SKY on the exchange and put it into the Grinder at a much higher price.&#x20;

If the price on the exchange exceeds the price in the Grinder, it would be more profitable to cancel the Grinder's order in the queue and sell the SKY on the market.&#x20;

Thus, the price on the exchange and in the Grinder queue will strongly correlate. But the burn price in the Grinder will likely be slightly higher than the exchange rate since it will take some time to process the order via the Grinder. In other words, if there is a possibility to swap SKY on the DEX immediately or through Grinder, say, within a week, then, obviously, the long wait must be somehow compensated.

### What happens if SKY collapses?

As has already been said, the prices in the Grinder queue and on the exchange correlate. If the price of SKY falls (relative to RAY), then the Grinder will start to consume (and burn) significantly more SKY. Therefore, at moments of deep SKY drawdowns, it will be burned at an accelerated pace.

### Won't the moment come when all the SKY is burned out?

When working, the Grinder does not burn all the SKY, but only a fraction equal to the percentage of the remaining SKY. For example, if a total of 70% SKY is left (and 30% was burned), the Grinder will burn 70% of the used SKY. Thus, the more SKY is burned, the slower it will burn. And when 99 000 000 SKY is burned (1 000 000 SKY remains), the SKY will completely stop being burned.

### Where will the first RAY tokens come from?

The initial RAY tokens must appear somehow to launch the system. Otherwise, it will be impossible to make any transactions. For that, Elysium will have a rule (both initially and in the future) that each new validator will receive 100 RAY as a gift.

### Will SKY be distributed evenly?

SKY will be distributed among validators as a reward. Since we plan to launch a network with about a thousand initial validators, and about 15% of the total SKY supply will be distributed among them in the first year, there should be no large SKY holders.&#x20;

Well, except for the Elysium Team, which needs a lot of tokens to create bridges, interact with centralized exchanges, provide grants for developers, etc. The additional reward the Team will receive through initially operating the network layer.
