We have been developing complex applications together for a long time. And at the same time, we have been interested in cryptocurrencies. From time to time, somebody of us shared a link to a new project with the comment: "well, why did they implement this functionality so stupidly?". And usually, we discussed how to do it the right way.&#x20;

At some moment, such insights accumulated enough for one of us to exclaim: "if you want to do something well, do it yourself." At that moment, we fell silent and began to look at each other in surprise. Then we worked almost around the clock for six months to polish the logic. And when there were no internal contradictions left, we decided to make the project public.
