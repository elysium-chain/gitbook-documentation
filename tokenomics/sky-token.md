#### **SKY issuance**

Validators' rewards will be calculated in RAY depending on the sum of burned commissions. SKY will be issued corresponding to that amount using a constant product formula. This means that the reduction of SKY token issuance will not occur in leaps and bounds, as in the case of Bitcoin halvings, but gradually.

#### SKY burning

If SKY is used to issue RAY, it will be burned. But if all the used SKY is burned, then sooner or later, it will simply run out. Therefore, a portion proportional to the remaining SKY will be burned. For example, if only a third of SKY is left, then a third of SKY used to mint RAY will be burned. And when only 1 000 000 SKYs remain, it will stop being burned.

## The idea behind SKY

The SKY token was designed primarily as an investment token. For that, it has everything needed:

* Its supply is limited and will be constantly diminished by burning.
* There will be permanent system demand for it.&#x20;

At the same time, it is designed so that if the SKY price drops relative to RAY, it will require significantly more SKY to print the same amount of RAY. And that will increase the burning SKY amount. Thus, in the long run, the SKY / RAY rate should rise steadily despite possible short-term drops.
