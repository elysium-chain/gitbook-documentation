Blockchain can be seen as a system that provides a service for its customers to store data in a decentralized manner. Thus, the commission for user transactions acts as payment for the work of nodes. Unlike the real world, where prices are set in fiat currencies, fees for the blockchain service are paid in coins stored within the system. But what kind of changes does this entail?

{% hint style="info" %}
If a cryptocurrency has its own blockchain, it is called a coin, unlike tokens, whose operations are processed by third-party blockchains. Thus, the description of the mechanics of how the blockchain economic model works should be called "coinomics."
{% endhint %}

The most common tokenomics model today is the one applied 13 years ago for Bitcoin. It implies that the number of coins is limited, and their issuance, which decreases over time to zero, comes as a reward to network nodes for making the system work. Therefore, users must buy them from node owners, often with fiat currency, to interact with the system.

It appears that users still pay nodes of the system in fiat currency but through an intermediate medium in the form of a blockchain coin. This payment arrangement has one indisputable advantage - because the number of coins is limited - when the system's popularity grows, its price skyrockets. But this same property also entails internal contradictions.

## Investments vs Coin Backing

As we already wrote in the [Positioning ](../introduction/positioning.md)section, Bitcoin is primarily a bank, and therefore, its main task is to safeguard the Bitcoins in users' accounts. So transactions can be thought of as depositing or withdrawing funds. With this approach, there is nothing wrong with a transaction taking an hour to process because the Bitcoin blockchain is not primarily a payment system.

In this model, the main concern is that funds are withdrawn at the expense of new users who want to invest in the system. Meaning that Bitcoin is rising in value because people buy it expecting it to become even more expensive.

{% hint style="info" %}
This is why short-sighted financial experts sometimes call Bitcoin a Ponzi scheme. But they are wrong - in addition to its function as a store of value, Bitcoin now also acts as a measure of value (e.g., WBTC on Ethereum) and a means of payment (Lightning Network).
{% endhint %}

The emergence of smart contracts in Ethereum was a milestone in the development of blockchain technology. Ethereum blockchain provided not merely the ability to store coins like the countless Bitcoin clones before but gave access to a full-fledged distributed computer. ETH became necessary not just to pay commissions when transferring itself between users but also to pay fees when using thousands of other tokens with various functionality. So ETH became the first cryptocurrency secured not just by supply and demand but also by actual network functionality.

But because of Bitcoin-like tokenomics, a conflict between network users and long-term holders has become apparent. Investors withdraw tokens from circulation, causing the price to rise, which raises costs for using the blockchain functionality that backs the coin. Thus, at the peak of the bull run, the commission on the use of smart contract functionality is prohibitive, reaching hundreds of dollars per transaction.

Imagine Netflix released its token with a limited supply, which is needed to pay for movies. Many people will want to buy it as an investment asset, causing its price to rise. Users wishing to watch movies will have to pay a lot more. This will lead to a decrease in the number of actual clients, while they are the key to the service's success and, consequently, the value of the issued token.

{% hint style="info" %}
That is why in the real world, paying for a service and investing in it are separated into two different types of assets: fiat currencies and stocks.

## Users vs Node Owners

Exchanging money for services or goods is such a simple and old concept that we don't even realize it hides a problem. It is faced mainly by people in developing countries suffering rapid currency depreciation. The local currency decline makes the population poorer since most goods in any country are imported in today's globalized world. But exporters in such countries, on the contrary, make excess profits because their income remains stable, and local costs relative to these revenues are reduced.

In the blockchain world, this problem is more pronounced as cryptocurrency users continue to live in the real world and use fiat money for living. As cryptocurrency rises, network node owners play the role of exporters in countries with weakening currencies. Their income increases while their living costs remain the same. But those who use the network for something other than investing or trading act as people getting poorer.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
For example, the transaction cost has a dramatic profitability impact on online business that involves cross-border cryptocurrency payments, especially if numerous transactions are assumed.
{% endhint %}

Thus, the users' and the node owners' interests directly contradict each other. For users, commissions are costs, and it is beneficial to reduce them. For node owners, fees are income, and it is profitable to increase them. But in an ideal world, the interests of users and node owners should coincide - both groups should be interested in the growth of network popularity and its further development.

Modern blockchains solve this problem through issuance, which provides the nodes with their profitability in the first place by the very high number of newly created coins at the start of the network and the numerous initial blockchain investors. So users pay a small fee, and nodes get the bulk of the reward with minted coins. But because issuance decreases over time, at some point, one of two things will happen anyway - either the income from the emission will not be enough to motivate node owners, or the fees will drastically increase.

Even Bitcoin, having most of its coins already created and its issuance significantly reduced relative to the initial stage of blockchain development, has this problem. There is still debate in the community about what will happen when its emission drops even further or stops entirely - whether the pure fees will be sufficient to motivate node owners.

{% hint style="info" %}
At some point, the following chain of events may occur. Bitcoin issuance during the halving will drop so much that it will become unprofitable to mine in the face of such competition. The number of miners will begin to decrease, and Bitcoin's hashrate will start dropping. This will make users nervous about blockchain security, and they will begin withdrawing money from Bitcoin. The price of Bitcoin will drop, making mining even more unprofitable.
{% endhint %}

Within standard single-coin tokenomics, it is impossible to balance the user costs with the node owners' revenues because of the real-world coin price volatility. But this balance is crucial for customer availability if blockchain provides unique functionality.

## Resume

It seems to us that it is almost impossible to make a consistent model of tokenomics on a single-coin basis - while using two coins makes it possible to resolve virtually all internal contradictions.
