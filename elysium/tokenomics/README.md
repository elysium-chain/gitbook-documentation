# ðŸ“ˆ Tokenomics

## Economy contradiction

There are at least three functions of money in any economics textbook: a measure of value, a means of payment, and a store of value.

But there is a paradox here. To begin with, we should note that deflation is one of the biggest problems in the economy. Why would anyone buy a car today if it will be cheaper in a year? For example, Japan has suffered deflation for almost three decades now, and, as a result, its economy is stagnating.

Therefore, one of the main drivers of economic growth is constant inflation or, in other words, the depreciation of the value of money. During inflation, people attempt to spend money as quickly as possible. And this speeds up the processes in the economy.

If money should constantly become cheaper to force economic growth, how can it be a store of value?

The paradox of money functions also appears in the cryptocurrency space. For example, when the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum increases, the commissions also go up. So, the better the cryptocurrency performs as a store of value, the worse it is as a means of payment.

## Fees, rewards, and the real world.

Initially, we thought of making a stablecoin, but after a more detailed study, it turned out that it would have more disadvantages than benefits.

The problem with tying a token to fiat currencies is the disproportionate size of the real-world economy and a particular blockchain. In the real world, though, $2 billion is a lot of money - it is still less than the margin of estimation error relative to the entire economy. On the other hand, in the cryptocurrency world, that amount could break a large enough project (like LUNA).

The main problem stablecoins face is the possible short-run withdrawals of large sums from the system. At that point, no matter how the token stabilization mechanism works -participants in the system will feel the pain.

In DAI, collateral is sold if the cryptocurrency exchange rate falls below a certain level, and users of the system, unlike ordinary holders, lose tokens forever.

In AMPL, it hurts to watch not only the price of tokens decrease but also their quantity in the wallet shrink.

The only protection against such drastic withdrawals of large amounts could be restrictions on the money flow from the system. But that's not a panacea either because if you have a lot of money, you can always find a way how to make as many accounts as needed to withdraw capital in chunks.

At the moment, we do not see a good solution to the problem of stablecoins where users will not start to panic when the system is under severe stress. Any economically sound solution takes months to find a new balance, and panic develops in hours.

But still, if a token has no real-world anchor, two opposite situations can occur sooner or later.

Either the token price will rise too high, and, as a result, transaction fees in the blockchain will become prohibitively expensive relative to the real world, hindering activity within the network. Or the token exchange rate will be too low, resulting in small rewards for validators and their subsequent exit from the system.&#x20;

Many modern blockchains make paltry commissions, and validators are additionally rewarded by token issuance. But this approach will not work in the long run. At some point, the issuance will become insufficient to retain validators since every blockchain has a limited supply of its token - and the only way not to exceed the limit is to reduce the minting over time. Or the token will rise, and the fees will not be paltry anymore. So in the end commissions always pay for validators' work.
