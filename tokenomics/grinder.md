## The Grinder, SKY/RAY and rock-n-roll

The Grinder knows how many RAYs have been burned and printed. Thus, it can create as much RAY as needed to make RAY’s volume in the economy equal to a predetermined amount. 

Moreover, this amount can change over time according to a specific formula. In essence, the Elysium Grinder acts as an automatic central bank.

As you know, in Elysium commissions are paid in RAYs. But how the Grinder compensates the amount printed? Burning SKY is the answer!

Grinder will determine which SKY tokens to burn by profitability — whoever offers to burn more SKY for the same amount of printed RAY will win. A queue will be formed for burning SKY: the higher the SKY/RAY rate offered for burning, the further in the line will be such an offer. This is similar to limit sell orders, with a constant limited buying volume from the Grinder.

## The Grinder and economic activity

The more transactions are in the system, the more SKY tokens will be redeemed from the market and burned. That would lead to a hyper-inflation of RAY token, but the Grinder has a solution for that!

The amount of printed RAY is determined by the inflation of it, amount of the transactions, commissions of the transactions etc. That means that the Grinder will burn as much SKY (the cheapest SKY offered by validators) as possible to print needed amount of RAY.

>This also means that the more RAY is burned in commissions, the more SKY will be "reprinted" in RAY in absolute terms.
