# ðŸ“¢ Outbreak Initiative

The main goal of the Outbreak Initiative is to build a community around the Elysium project, with further participation of its members in the Pioneer Program. For that purpose, many NFTs will be gifted during marketing events to attract new members. Those NFTs that will be sold will provide initial funding for the Elysium Team.

## FAQ

### Why should I buy your NFT?

All our NFTs have utility and will be demanded during the Pioneer Program. So even if you don't want to go further with Elysium, you can always sell NFTs to Pioneer Program participants at a profit.

The closer the launch of Elysium - the fewer NFTs distributed during the Outbreak Initiative will remain, and the more people will be eager to become one of the initial validators. In other words, over time (up to the launch of Elysium), the demand for NFTs will increase, and supply will decrease.

### Why are there 9000 access keys? Isn't that too much? <a href="#2768" id="2768"></a>

Some of the keys will be lost or forgotten. Some will burn for the Pioneer Program boosts. Some holders will use their keys to access the Pioneer Program but will never participate. Some will participate only at the start. Thus, we expect only a minority of initial key owners to be persistent enough to finish the Pioneer Program before the Elysium launch.

### Why do you distribute access key NFTs on four different networks? <a href="#75c1" id="75c1"></a>

By spreading collections in different networks, we achieve multiple goals:

* we diversify NFT holders as much as possible;
* we limit the number of NFTs in one network, thereby creating a deficit;
* we attract different networks apologists to our project;
* we have a much wider choice of marketplaces and launchpads to attract the audience.

### Are you selling NFTs because you need investment? <a href="#c2f5" id="c2f5"></a>

Of course, we need investment! We worked for half a year on Elysium before we made it public. Until the moment when the project can pay for itself, at least a year will pass, and all this time, we need to live somehow. Money will also allow, if necessary, to carry out advertising campaigns or hire third-party specialists.

But we do not want to attract venture funds, and they are unlikely to want to invest in a truly decentralized blockchain. In addition, we will not have any tokens in advance in the Elysium blockchain, so we will have nothing to share. Therefore, we will raise money mainly through the sale of NFTs.

### What can you say to the multi-accounters? <a href="#2567" id="2567"></a>

We accept the challenge and will try to fight them by all available methods. So, if suddenly we ask you to cook some pilaf and send us a picture of it â€” thatâ€™s only to make sure you are not a robot! :smile:

But seriously, multi-accounts are just a great example of Sybilâ€™s attacks. So weâ€™ll make it impossible to automate anything for the bots in the Pioneer Program, and it will be impossible to progress manually using multiple accounts, either. Checkmate, multi-account gentlemen!

### Will we become rich by participating in the Elysium project? <a href="#2f10" id="2f10"></a>

There is only one way things can go according to plan. And there is an infinite number of ways to mess things up.

As with any innovation at the stage of its creation, there are a lot of risks. But we have a good plan and a strong community to help us overcome difficulties.

As for wealth, we should say that this project is the project of our lives for the next several years, and we will do everything for its success, which will reward every participant.
