## Economy contradiction

There are at least three functions of money in any economics textbook: a measure of value, a means of payment, and a store of value.

But there is a paradox here. To begin with, we should note that deflation is one of the biggest problems in the economy. Why would anyone buy a car today if it will be cheaper in a year? For example, Japan has suffered deflation for almost three decades now, and, as a result, its economy is stagnating.

Therefore, one of the main drivers of economic growth is constant inflation or, in other words, the depreciation of the value of money. During inflation, people attempt to spend money as quickly as possible. And this speeds up the processes in the economy.

If money should constantly become cheaper to force economic growth, how can it be a store of value?

The paradox of money functions also appears in the cryptocurrency space. For example, when the price of Bitcoin or Ethereum increases, the commissions also go up. So, the better the cryptocurrency performs as a store of value, the worse it is as a means of payment.
