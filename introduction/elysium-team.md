We have been developing complex applications together for a long time. And at the same time, we have been interested in cryptocurrencies. From time to time, somebody of us shared a link to a new project with the comment: "well, why did they implement this functionality so stupidly?". And usually, we discussed how to do it the right way.&#x20;

At some moment, such insights accumulated enough for one of us to exclaim: "if you want to do something well, do it yourself." At that moment, we fell silent and began to look at each other in surprise. Then we worked almost around the clock for six months to polish the logic. And when there were no internal contradictions left, we decided to make the Elysium project public.

### FAQ

#### Are you qualified to develop a blockchain?

Well, we certainly do not create a new blockchain every Tuesday. Frankly, this is the first blockchain we are developing.

But we have rich experience creating vastly different software, and we don\`t see anything super complicated in the blockchain node code. It\`s just an ordinary program.

The complexity lies in the interaction logic of various nodes but not in the code itself. And we have already thought it through.

But if we lack some competencies, we hope to attract developers from our community. In general, if you like our ideas and want to live in a world where Elysium exists, feel free to contact us, and we will figure out how you can help the project, even if you are not a developer.

#### But wait: doesn\`t blockchain development require a big team and significant funding?

The corporate world often obeys weird laws. Here is a real-life story for you. One bank needed to refine the logic of its accounting software. It was a task for a few days at most, so we billed them $1,000. After a couple of days, they refused. Later we discovered they had hired a big company for $300,000 to do the same thing.

It happened not because we underestimated the size of the necessary workâ€Š-â€Šwe have done a lot of similar tasks before! It is corporate psychology when a manager relieves himself of responsibility by hiring a big company. If something goes wrong, he will claim that he did everything right: he hired a market leader for a lot of money.

And in a big company, there is a hierarchical chain of 8 bosses above one real programmer, each with a good salary.

It is not difficult to code the core of a complex system in several months if you know what you are doing. And because we are doing an open-source project, many contributors will join us later.

#### Why are you anonymous?

Satoshi Nakamoto also decided not to reveal himself for some reason. Publicity causes misleading confidence and allows one to collect much more money. But, unfortunately, it does not guarantee anythingâ€Š-â€Šremember the story of the collapse of Terra.&#x20;

We do not need a lot of money to complete the project. And the risks of being public are enormous. For example, the attention of the SEC. Or a restriction to developing blockchains in the country where we live. Or simple bandits in case of resounding success. Does Vitalik Buterin have security? And if not, is he afraid to walk down the street?
