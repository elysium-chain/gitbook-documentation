# INTRO TO TOKENOMICS

## Economies and their energy

Every economic system has its power which can converted into some kind of a value. We can see different types of this power during the human history. From alcohol and cows to coins and banknotes. And finally - **Crypto**. 

Is there a significant difference between backing cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies like USA dollar? The real answer is **no**. All of them backed with theirs economical activity.

> If someone asks: "What the systems tokens are backed by?"

>Feel free to answer: "By the activity of blockchain users"

## Money and their functions

There are 3 functions of money in the modern human world:

* The measure of value
* Means of payment
* Means of accumulation

The problem is that the second and the last functions are **directly opposite**. If the currency has inflation it gives a good boost for the economical activity, but it is a bad investment. On the other hand with a deflationary currency people spend less.

> We are going to solve this problem by using 2 tokens in tokenomics

## Deeper into the tokenomics

Tokenomics is a closed self-sustaining system. Unfortunately, this leads to the next problem. Let's start from afar.

Participants in tokenomics at a basic level are divided into two types: validators and users. Validators process transactions and receive fees for it. Users pay these commissions for their economic activity. What is the problem, you ask? 

The problem is how to keep the transactions low for the common users, but still attract validators to keep the blockchain? 

>We have the solution for it. It will not be tied to fiat currencies. We will talk more about it in the "Grinder" article
